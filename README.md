# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A cardiac computed tomography (CT ) scan uses many X-rays from different angles to construct images of your heart using a scanner and computer. This quick but detailed and high-resolution scan shows your healthcare provider problems with your heart structure, valves, arteries, aorta and more.
This project is based on CT scan images. I have got the dataset from kaggle Open source website, the dataset contains 14 basic inforamtion of more than 300+ peiple. Based on the data, I have tried to predict whether a customer has Heart Disease or not by key in some parameters. 
To complete this project, I have used machine learning algorithm like Logistic Regression. And for the coding platform, Google Colab has been used.
